# Description for the app

The app is created according to the reference image provided.

I have used 'Rubik' as the primary font family throughout the app.

Also some extra components are added such as information of some of the extra hotels.

The rating given to each of the hotel were considered to be out of or among 5.0.

The app is made with some added modifications such as 
- [if the page of the app is not loaded on single page, 
   the user is able to scroll up and down to load remaining page.]

Multiple font families are added but not all are used.

Images are added as per requirements.

Extra buttons were added for making the app more user friendly.

The output of the app is recorded and added in the 'output' directory under 'Project'.

If any difficulties occurred while loading the app or cloning the app,

# Notes

Some of the elements shown in the sample or reference image were not taken as they were instead
some relatable elements are used.

Some of the elements are few icons, few pictures, and font family.

The second page is called using 'modal bottom screen'.
